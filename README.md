**Components**
- Arduni UNO.
- L239D Motor Driver.
- DC Motor.
  
**Explanation**

Pin Definitions: The motor control pins (motorPin1 and motorPin2) and the enable pin (enablePin) are defined at the beginning.

Setup Function: The setup function initializes the motor control pins as outputs and ensures the motor is stopped initially.
